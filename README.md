# Amazon-Forest-Fire-Analysis

# Objective
The objective of this analysis is to gain insights into the patterns and trends of forest fires in the Amazon rainforest. By analyzing historical data, we aim to understand the factors influencing fire occurrence, seasonal variations, and geographical distribution. These insights can inform conservation efforts, policy-making, and proactive measures for fire prevention and management.

# Overview
This repository contains the code and analysis for studying Amazon forest fires using data sourced from Kaggle. The analysis includes various insights such as the total number of fires registered, monthly and yearly trends, state-wise analysis, and more.

# Data Source
The dataset used for this analysis was obtained from Kaggle and covers the period from 1998 to 2017.

# Tools Used
The analysis was performed using the following tools:

Jupyter Notebook: Used for importing and analyzing the dataset, conducting exploratory data analysis, and generating visualizations.

# Analysis
Total Number of Fires: The total number of fires registered in the dataset is 6422.

### December Month Analysis:
States where fires were reported in December: 'Acre', 'Alagoas', 'Amapa', 'Amazonas', 'Bahia', 'Ceara', 'Distrito Federal', 'Espirito Santo', 'Goias', 'Maranhao', 'Mato Grosso', 'Minas Gerais', 'Pará', 'Paraiba', 'Pernambuco', 'Piau', 'Rio', 'Rondonia', 'Roraima', 'Santa Catarina', 'Sao Paulo', 'Sergipe', 'Tocantins'.

### Key Findings
Seasonal Patterns: Fire incidents exhibit seasonal variations, with peaks during dry seasons.
Spatial Distribution: Certain regions within the Amazon basin are more prone to fires, often influenced by human activities such as deforestation and agricultural practices.
Impact of Environmental Factors: Factors such as temperature, humidity, and land use significantly influence the likelihood and severity of fire incidents.
